Usually I either come up with a solution quickly because I&amp;rsquo;ve already solved a similar problem or I get stuck for a long time, drawing lots of example inputs on paper until I see a pattern. Recently I was able to solve a problem properly, by coming up with observations and then deriving the solution from these.</description></item><item><title>How to gain intutition on isolation levels</title><link>http://kolosovi.github.io/posts/how-to-gain-intuition-on-isolation-levels/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Aug 2022 23:22:00 +0300</pubDate><guid>http://kolosovi.github.io/posts/how-to-gain-intuition-on-isolation-levels/</guid><description>I was preparing to interview a candidate for a software engineering position today. The hypocrite that I am, I decided to ask them some tricky questions about databases, isolation levels in particular. So I decided to refresh my memory on this topic and here&amp;rsquo;s the steps that I took:
Revisited the relevant sections of Martin Kleppman&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Designing Data-Intensive Applications&amp;rdquo;, namely &amp;ldquo;Weak isolation levels&amp;rdquo; in chapter 7 (link to the book); Skimmed through PostgreSQL documentation on isolation levels; And most importantly read through a brilliant post by Justin Jaffray (&amp;ldquo;What Does Write Skew Look Like?</description></item></channel></rss>
